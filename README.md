# Banking-System
Backend system for a bank where users can perform basic operations like creating an account, logging in, checking their balance, withdrawing and depositing money, and viewing the last transaction. The program uses an object-oriented approach and stores user data (like username, password, balance, and last transaction) in a simple BankAccount class.
